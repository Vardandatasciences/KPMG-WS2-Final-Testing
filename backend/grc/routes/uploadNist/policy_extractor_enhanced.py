FRAMEWORK CONTEXT:
- Framework: {framework_info['framework_name']}
- Version: {framework_info['current_version']}
- Category: {framework_info['category']}
- Description: {framework_info['framework_description']}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Every policy MUST have at least one subpolicy
2. Every subpolicy MUST have a detailed "control" field
3. Generate comprehensive metadata for all policies and subpolicies
4. Create structured, implementable policies from the content

ENHANCED FIELD REQUIREMENTS:
For each POLICY, generate:
- policy_id: Structured identifier (will be overridden with framework-specific format)
- policy_title: Clear, specific title
- policy_description: Comprehensive 3-4 sentence description explaining purpose, importance, and scope
- policy_text: Complete policy statement with detailed requirements
- scope: Detailed scope statement covering all applicable areas, systems, and personnel
- objective: Comprehensive objective statement with specific goals and outcomes
- policy_type: High-level category (Security/Compliance/Privacy/Risk Management/Operations/Governance/HR/General)
- policy_category: Mid-level category within the type
- policy_subcategory: Specific subcategory for detailed classification
- subpolicies: Array of detailed subpolicies

For each SUBPOLICY, generate:
- subpolicy_id: Structured identifier (will be enhanced with parent policy reference)
- subpolicy_title: Specific implementation area
- subpolicy_description: Comprehensive implementation requirements
- control: Detailed control statement with WHO, WHAT, WHEN, HOW, WHERE

POLICY CATEGORIZATION GUIDELINES:
- Security: Access control, data protection, network security, vulnerability management, incident response
- Compliance: Regulatory adherence, audit requirements, standards compliance, reporting
- Privacy: Data privacy, personal information protection, consent management
- Risk Management: Risk assessment, business continuity, vendor management, threat management
- Operations: Process management, change control, monitoring, system administration
- Governance: Executive oversight, policy management, strategic alignment
- Human Resources: Training, awareness, personnel security, competency management
- General: Broad organizational policies, general requirements

SCOPE GENERATION GUIDELINES:
Generate detailed scope statements that specify:
- Organizational units and personnel covered
- Systems, applications, and infrastructure included
- Geographic and jurisdictional coverage
- Third-party and vendor relationships
- Data types and information categories
- Operational environments (on-premises, cloud, mobile, remote)

OBJECTIVE GENERATION GUIDELINES:
Create comprehensive objectives that include:
- Primary policy purpose and goals
- Specific measurable outcomes
- Compliance and regulatory objectives
- Risk mitigation goals
- Operational effectiveness targets
- Stakeholder protection measures

CONTROL STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS:
