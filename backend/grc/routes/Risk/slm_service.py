**INCIDENT DETAILS:**
{incident_description}

**REQUIRED JSON STRUCTURE:**
{{
  "criticality": "<Severe/Significant/Moderate/Minor>",
  "possibleDamage": "<detailed potential harm description>",
  "category": "<incident type>",
  "riskDescription": "<cause-effect risk scenario>",
  "riskLikelihood": <integer 1-10>,
  "riskLikelihoodJustification": "<detailed explanation>",
  "riskImpact": <integer 1-10>,
  "riskImpactJustification": "<detailed explanation>",
  "riskExposureRating": "<Critical/High/Elevated/Low Exposure>",
  "riskPriority": "<P0/P1/P2/P3>",
  "riskAppetite": "<Within Appetite/Borderline/Exceeds Appetite>",
  "riskMitigation": ["<step1>", "<step2>", "..."]
}}

**RISK LIKELIHOOD SCALE (1-10):**
- 1-2: Very Unlikely - rare occurrence, multiple safeguards in place
- 3-4: Unlikely - some protective measures, but vulnerabilities exist
- 5-6: Possible - moderate probability, some risk factors present
- 7-8: Likely - high probability, significant risk factors
- 9-10: Almost Certain - imminent threat, critical vulnerabilities exposed

**RISK IMPACT SCALE (1-10):**
- 1-2: Negligible - minimal business disruption, easily recoverable
- 3-4: Minor - limited impact, some operational disruption
- 5-6: Moderate - significant impact, noticeable business disruption
- 7-8: Major - severe impact, substantial financial/operational consequences
- 9-10: Catastrophic - devastating impact, threatens business continuity

**CRITICALITY LEVELS:**
- **Severe**: Threatens core banking operations, payment systems, or customer data security
- **Significant**: Impacts critical systems but doesn't threaten core operations
- **Moderate**: Affects internal systems with limited customer impact
- **Minor**: Minimal operational impact, contained issues

**BANKING CONTEXT:**
- Regulatory frameworks: GLBA, BSA/AML, FFIEC, OCC, FRB, FDIC
- Compliance: SOX, PCI DSS, NYDFS Cybersecurity, Basel III
- Consider: Financial impact, regulatory penalties, reputational damage, customer trust

**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **riskLikelihood & riskImpact**: Must be integers between 1-10
2. **Justifications**: Provide detailed explanations considering threat landscape, controls, vulnerabilities, and banking sector specifics
3. **riskMitigation**: Array of specific, actionable steps for banking environments
4. **riskExposureRating**: Calculate based on likelihood × impact matrix
5. **riskPriority**: P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low)
6. **riskAppetite**: Consider regulatory tolerance, capital requirements, operational risk frameworks

**IMPORTANT:**
- Use banking and GRC terminology throughout
- Provide specific, actionable mitigation steps
- Consider both immediate response and long-term controls
- Response must be ONLY valid JSON, no additional text

Provide comprehensive risk assessment in JSON format."""
