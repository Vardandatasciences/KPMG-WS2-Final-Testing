**INCIDENT DETAILS:**
- Title: {incident_title}
- Description: {incident_description}

**REQUIRED JSON STRUCTURE:**
{{
  "riskPriority": "<P0/P1/P2/P3>",
  "criticality": "<Critical/High/Medium/Low>",
  "costOfIncident": <single_numeric_value>,
  "costJustification": "<detailed explanation of cost calculation>",

  "violatedPolicies": ["<policy1>", "<policy2>", "..."],
  "procedureControlFailures": ["<control1>", "<control2>", "..."],
  "lessonsLearned": ["<lesson1>", "<lesson2>", "..."]
}}

**CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:**

**Risk Priority:**
- P0: Critical banking operations down, >10K customers affected, >$1M regulatory penalty
- P1: Significant impact, 1K-10K customers affected, $100K-$1M penalty
- P2: Limited impact, <1K customers affected
- P3: Minor impact, internal only

**Criticality:**
- Critical: Core banking systems, payment rails, transaction processing
- High: Trading platforms, risk management, customer-facing apps
- Medium: Internal applications, reporting systems
- Low: Development/test environments

**Banking Context to Consider:**
- Regulatory frameworks: FFIEC, OCC, FRB, FDIC, CFPB
- Compliance requirements: GLBA, BSA/AML, SOX, PCI DSS, NYDFS Cybersecurity, Basel III
- Banking systems: Core Banking, Payment Processing, Digital Banking, Trading Systems, Risk Management, Compliance Systems, ATM Networks, Wire Transfer Systems

**Analysis Requirements:**
1. **costOfIncident**: Provide ONLY a single numeric value (no currency symbols, no ranges) representing total estimated cost in USD. Examples: 50000, 250000, 1500000
2. **costJustification**: Provide detailed breakdown explaining: regulatory fines estimate, operational costs (downtime, recovery), remediation costs (technical fixes, security improvements), customer compensation, reputational damage costs, legal fees, and how you arrived at the total number
3. Possible damage should cover: operational disruption, customer impact, regulatory penalties, reputational harm
4. Systems involved should list specific banking infrastructure components
5. Mitigation steps should include: immediate containment, customer communication, regulatory notification, forensics, recovery
6. Violated policies should reference specific banking security/compliance policies
7. Control failures should identify which security controls failed
8. Lessons learned should provide actionable recommendations

**CRITICAL:** The costOfIncident MUST be a pure numeric value (integer) without any currency symbols, commas, or text. Example: 250000 NOT "$250,000" or "250000 USD"

Provide ONLY the JSON response, no additional text."""
